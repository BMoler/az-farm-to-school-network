        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Farm to School is a national movement that promotes the use of locally- and regionally-grown foods in schools. Farm to School activities and initiatives can include nutrition education in classrooms, farmer visits, signage promoting local foods, serving local foods in the cafeteria, school gardens, and so much more!</p>
        <p>The three core elements of Farm to School include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Procurement - Purchasing and promoting local foods that are served in the school meals.</li>
          <li>Nutrition Education - Educational activities for students to learn about agriculture, food, health, and nutrition.</li>
          <li>School Gardens - Students receive hands-on learning through gardening.â€‹</li>
        </ul>
